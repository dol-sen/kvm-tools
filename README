This copy of kvm-init-script has a bugfix from the one at 
http://www.pkgcore.org/~ferringb/kvm-example-conf-funtoo
It also adds printing the vnc port number to the "Starting..."
 message.  This makes it easier to know the port # to connect to with 
 vnc viewer , etc.  Usefull info when you run several vm's at the same time.


the instructions are quite simple.


	cp kvm-init-script /etc/init.d/kvm
	cp kvm-conf.example /etc/conf.d/kvm.example


Edit the kvm.example changing mac address, vnc port, etc. as needed.
You can see I have several OTHER_ARGS= lines pre-defined, so that it is easy to
 switch the boot up options by just commenting/uncommenting the desired line.
 
 Hmm, this could probably be extended to accept startup options that can select
 	which OTHER_ARGS=line to use for the startup.

Save it to /etc/kvm.instance-name 

create the init script instance with a matching name

	ln -s /etc/init.d/kvm /etc/init.d/kvm.instance-name

then start it;

	/etc/init.d/kvm.instance-name start
	
It also responds to stop, reboot (which sends the vm the reboot signal,
   so it can do a proper shutdown/reboot).
   
It can also be added to different run levels using rc-update.
